# Connect-Four

The classic board game Connect four recreated in code. Also included a AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm with slight modifications for increased perfomences.

Also it's all stuffed into one executable file.

Current State: 
  For some odd reason the Ai seems to no longer be making the most intelligent decisions. Investigating issue.
